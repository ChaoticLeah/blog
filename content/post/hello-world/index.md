## Where I used to write my blogs

Today is the day where I finally set up a blog! I did write a blog post [here](https://blog.winter-software.com/2024/04/01/Making_Your_First_Misskey_Plugin) before. That will stay, but ill probably pull that post into here to keep all my posts in 1 place. I also like this better than the other blog site because although I love helping out and using my friends software I would have to wait for them to approve any new articles or changes to articles I make... Which if I make a mistake and want to change it quickly is kinda a pain. (nothing against the software tho, its neat!)

## Motivation for making my own blog site

Well as I said I like that I can edit things whenever without having to go through a review, but I also liked the idea of being able to customize the style of this blog, and add stuff. (I love to tweak and customize). And yes this blog right now is from a template but I have already tweaked and added to it! I also wanted to use my domain more and thought it would be neat to put my blogs on here too! Oh also I love self hosting stuff soo.

## Anyways what will I be posting here?

Probably me explaining stuff that I have worked on, tutorials, maybe some trans stuff, but we will see.

Alright thats it for now byee!
