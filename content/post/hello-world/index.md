Today is the day where I finally set up a blog! I did write a blog post [here](https://blog.winter-software.com/2024/04/01/Making_Your_First_Misskey_Plugin) before. That will stay, but ill probably pull that post into here to keep all my posts in 1 place. I also like this better than the other blog site because although I love helping out and using my friends software I would have to wait for them to approve any new articles or changes to articles I make... Which if I make a mistake and want to change it quickly is kinda a pain.

## Anyways what will I be posting here?

Probably me explaining stuff that I have worked on, tutorials, maybe some trans stuff, but we will see.

Alright thats it for now byee!
