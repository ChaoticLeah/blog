This blog is a bit different from normal. There's no tutorial, nothing I'm showing off, just me collecting my thoughts since I started playing this game it really caught me. No other game has done that since DDLC. But why? And what can I learn from it as a gamedev?

{{% callout title="Spoiler warning!" type="warning" %}}
If you plan to play either DDLC or MiSide I suggest doing that before reading onwards. I also have not played all of MiSide and am probably 1/6th of the way into that so I'm probably missing a lot here.

## What does this game and DDLC have in common

Right off the bat, I can think of a few things they have in common: They both are anime-themed, but I don't think this is a main factor but I do think the cute factor contrasts well with the horror. What really gets me is the 4th wall breaks, the stuff it does is unique. I don't tend to care for mainstream horror, jumpscare here, jumpscare there. I way prefer psychological horror. I also love it when stuff has a meaning! 

## Gimmicks and unique mechanics!
Both these games do great jobs at breaking the 4th wall, but not just that: I love games with unique gimmicks. Both of these games use interesting gimmicks that make me think in different ways that a typical puzzle won't allow for. I mean yeah Candy Crush is a puzzle but it's predictable. You know all the rules, and for some this is great! For me (the game breaker as I've kinda got a reputation from people who know me) I prefer to try stuff outside of that typical box. Usually, I'm let down and it does nothing. Sometimes it does something: usually in this case it bugs out or behaves unexpectedly but I find this solution a whole lot more fun since I came up with it. I didn't take the easy way out. It may have taken me longer but I found something all on my own! These thinking out-of-the-box puzzles make me think this way and I love it! It can be messing with the file system, to a reality where space doesn't work the way I expect it (That's why I love games like Superluminal). I get an outcome I can't quickly predict. For me, games have become too predictable... Maybe it's because I'm a game dev, or maybe it's because I like to figure stuff out but whatever reason that's why I prefer these non-traditional puzzles over normal ones. 

## The sound
Next up is the sound design: MiSide has a great sound design, and the music is also really nice. I'm listening to the OST right now as I write this. It fits the moments well and ties it all together... Same with DDLC's music. Also other than the music the little button press sounds and everything are so good! For a horror game sound design is really important and I think they nailed it and hit out of the park here in many places... It's not just fitting but also satisfying (I found myself just hovering my mouse back and forth over the menu just to hear the little hover sounds)

## The characters
Next up is the characters. Both of these are disguised as dating sims, and while that's probably not what gets me into them I do think they do a good job at making me connect with the characters... even if so they can crush my heart 3 seconds later while they try to kill me or something. And heck MiSide (as far as I've played) does have some really fun characters who don't want to kill me. The stupid side minigame with Cool Mita or the hammer game... they were all fun and I wanted them to continue. Not because the games were super fun though, but because I felt like I was really there with a person... So how did they do that?

### Personality
I think they did this in a few ways all of which add personality to the character. First off I'm sure the cute character design plays a part but character design is also done around their personalities which is fun. Next up how they speak has personality. Not only does the excited Mita have her text shake more, explode, and is a lot bigger than all the others talking (This is a concept I brought up a few years ago after seeing it once or twice and I love seeing more games just using text styling and animation for emotions and personality)â€”the way the text moves and falls gives it personality. The sad Mita has her text slowly fall apart and slide down sadly after each sentence with little energy. Next up is the animation: It matches their emotions and personality! The cool Mita (who is really energetic) is really jump and also why we play tons of party games... the games around her are built with her in mind, and she fits well into them. After all it's her house, so it makes sense she would have this stuff. Lastly is the small stuff: The little movements and quirks we all have and the subtle teasing humor that someone close to you might use. She is not just a blank slate but has some traits like she is a little bit of an airhead, and loves music, among other things. Sharing these things with me made me connect. Making jokes in a bad situation to lighten the mood was super relatable. They feel real, and I feel for them. I want to help them, be with them, and so on. That is how you make a game I'll remember... make me get emotionally attached to it or your characters.

#### Text Demo!
If you want to convey fear just saying "Uhh What was that?" might not do it. However 

{{< color "red" >}}
    {{< shake speed="0.3s" intensity="2px" >}}Uhh  What  was  that?{{< /shake >}}
{{< /color >}}

will probably work way better. You can tell the person saying that is afraid or jittery from the text shaking and the red also further shows fear or anger.

## Polish
Other than that I also appreciate a good level of polish. Too often both Indie and AAA games are letdowns on the level of polish. I mean in AAA games you can't even guarantee the whole main game works as intended, and Indie games understandably can skimp out on details due to having a small team: But both DDLC and MiSide didn't do this! MiSide has buttery smooth animations. In the kitchen scene, you can see her flipping each tomato in the pan. They didn't need to go that far but it makes it feel good! Same with Cappie (Cool Mita), if you nod at her she nods back which is fun, gives her personality, and a little extra secret to find. DDLC doesn't quite have great animations but it (and MiSide) both use visual effects really well! 

### The menu
I love this style of menu: it instantly reminded me of Detroit become human. The first time I saw the menu of Detroit become human I knew I wanted to make something like that that had a personality, looked nice, had easter eggs, and was playful. There's a lot this menu does right. Again it's a part of the polish that is usually overlooked. I mean so often even I overlook the menu when making a game and think "it has a play button, it works. Nobody cares about the menu"(or more likely I don't think about it at all and just put something together that looks nice and works)... but I do. I love the interaction with the character on the menu where if you poke them too much they brush your mouse away. I also love how their eyes follow your cursor, and how they get a little sad when you are about to quit the game. The fact I care about the characters also adds a whole new bit of personality to the menu.

### Other easter eggs
There are tons of little things to find, it's easy to miss if you don't look. This game will show you more if you explore. Some of it makes no sense yet like why there is a soda can with a pencil in it and a sticky note on it hidden in almost every room. Though these are rewards that are fun and might unlock some lore it also has things that can unlock more game content. If you find her glasses then you can have her put it on. There are tons of these little things that are not super important but just add that extra layer of feeling like I am not stuck on 1 path, and sometimes I'm sure these little moments can diverge the story a lot more than I'll probably realize in the moment. They also just add fun little things for people who like the game to find, and collect.

## The story
The story isn't predictable. I don't see right through it like in Bioshock, and I feel like my choices have meaning... even if they really don't (though the game has multiple endings which I love so I assume my choices have meaning). I'm not a fan of linear games, I see through them too fast. I try to solve the puzzles in my own way. The story in MiSide allows you to make choices, you can miss stuff, you can find secrets, and you get rewarded for exploring. I also am sitting at the edge of my seat like what happens next? When is that jumpscare coming? Am I safe? I also am not just spoonfed the story, I get bits here, bits there, and since I care about the characters and the world I want to put it together. I'm not just flat-out told the story, that's for me to figure out.
### Side story: Why I am not a fan of BioShock
I remember in BioShock I had to put out a fire and I was trying to use something I had on hand that should in theory work. It didn't. I tried other things, It also didn't work. There was 1 solution, and no guidance even more frustratingly so I spent like 2 hours running in circles retracing all my steps to find the right solution which was super annoying. I mean to me I could see through the story right at the start, it wasn't particularly interesting, I never made my own choices and after a while, I didn't care. I couldn't do the wrong thing. I couldn't even burn myself on the fire from the plane crash if I wanted to. Not even small stuff like this. I felt like if I wanted a story I had no say in I'd watch a movie, anime, or TV series.

## Not just pure horror
Too many mainstream horror games go with 100% horror all the time. This one lets me be terrified 1 moment, and recollect myself in a nice calm scene in another. I like this balance. The characters also making jokes here and there to lighten it up reminds me slightly of murder drones. A game that is 100% horror all the time can have lore and other stuff but it doesn't give you much time to connect with characters, it doesn't let me care about the world or anything.

## Some extra reasons
Overall just everything fits, the world makes enough sense and I feel for the characters. I love the quirky nature of the puzzles... I love puzzle games like this, it's like these games were made for me. I'm also super happy since too often anime games are super low quality... this one isn't... and it's made by 2 main devs??? (afaik) woww I could gush on and on right now about this. This game is the first one in a long time to inspire me again, to make me genuinely have fun. In the past probably 10 years I can name only 2-3 games that made me feel this excited: DDLC, Celeste, and MiSide.


## Some more personal thoughts
Most games try to stray away from the gimmicks: they are experimental, if the gimmick goes good it goes great! ....But if it goes bad then the whole thing can be a total flop especially if its a main mechanic. That's why I feel like most games stick to the tried and tested methods. Indie games have more freedom; They don't have to impress investors yet or anything. This is why I love indie games! This is why I like being an indie dev! 

## Related Personal projects
Ever since I played DDLC I wanted to make a horror game. Actually, I came up with a good few ideas used in MiSide. I had some sort of messy story too but what always stopped me from pursuing these ideas is the fact that I thought the puzzles were too jank, might make no sense, perhaps the story or whatever was cringe, maybe the whole thing didn't make perfect sense in this world. These 2 games have shown me that both of these things don't matter. Your game world can have its own rules that make no sense: you just need to explain it to the player or make it self-explanatory. And the whole being cringe thing: Someone will always find it cringe, and others will find it amazing. Many people find both DDLC and MiSide cringe just for it being an anime game, and to these people judging a book by its cover without playing it.... It is what it is. I have to stop being afraid to try new things or afraid it's not perfect or I'll never release a game. I want to try to release a story-based game, perhaps even a horror game. 

## Gamejam story and takeaways
A while ago I even did it for the cookie jam. It was a small game I wasn't going to join but I tried my hand at story in a half-made custom game engine in like 2 days so it was pretty bad... but hey it even won first place in some areas. So if I was able to get that done in 3 days while debugging a game engine I'm sure I could make a more fun story game in more time. Also since then, I think (and hope) that my storytelling abilities have gotten way better. Its going to be hard to shake the feeling that it has to be perfect. Honestly, it being a gamejam helped me a bit knowing it could never be perfect in that time. Also that gamejams are a great time to try some wacky stuff. I'm considering perhaps making a small personal jam just for me. Maybe if anyone is interested I'll announce it and we can see what cool things we can make in say a week, 2 weeks, or whatever I decide. I feel like that way ill force myself to not scope creep so I get it done, worry less about it being perfect, and get something out so I can show others and myself that I can get stuff done and am not incapable before I burn out yet again. Though this is all stuff I will have to figure out, and it probably won't be for a while but send me a message if that sounds fun.

## Old horror game plans
I might continue this, but the core concept I came up with was from git version control and a corrupted AI. Not quite the same as miside but it certainly has some simularities. I think that with a different story and some work it could be its own fun thing and not a ripoff of these games. Ill have to see though, id want to make something unique if I do! Also ive got to learn how to 3d model characters if im going to even attempt 3D.

## What I'm doing with my train game (and my current thoughts on it.)
I'm sure at least one of you reading enjoys my train game, and don't worry it's not over. I'm just quite busy trying to survive university. I'm not replacing that project with a horror game. I might mess around with some ideas on the side but I actually am taking away some things from this horror game for my train game, and no don't worry it's not about to become a trippy train horror game 4th wall-breaking puzzle game. The story, characters, and the feeling of belonging that they all bring, the feeling of helping them. I want to try to bring this all to the train game. For months I've been debating if the player should have a body or just be floating. From a purely building standpoint, I think floating is better. I think for building I might make you float. I also feel like from an emotional connections standpoint the fact that you have no body will make it hard to connect to others and the world around you. I had been considering this for a while because having no physical body makes you feel detached from the world. Taking some time to get from point A to point B on your train doesn't have to be a bad thing. If you hate it: design your train better so you can get between floors easier, but stuff taking time and taking it slow will help you build a connection. I want to make the people who come on the train memorable.... Or at least have some core story characters who you need to help out who you will connect with and remember.
