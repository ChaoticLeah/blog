It&rsquo;s confusing. I&rsquo;m still confused. This post is not like my others: It&rsquo;s just going to be me breaking down my thoughts on gender. I don&rsquo;t think I can even make a dent in this subject though.</p><h2 id=what-is-it-historically>What is it historically?</h2><p>Growing up I was taught that gender is defined by what&rsquo;s in your pants; What hardware you were born with. But why? Why is this information I need to know about every person I meet? Gender is also typically used to know how to treat someone and that also often leads to stereotypes.</p><h2 id=why-does-it-matter>Why does it matter?</h2><p>Gender being traditionally defined as what is in your pants makes it something that I feel is useless. And using what is in your pants to define how you should act, what you will like, and other things is dumb. Yes AFAB and AMAB people do produce different hormones that tell the body physically how to make itself, but that doesn&rsquo;t define much else.</p><h2 id=a-new-type-of-gender>A new type of gender</h2><p>With this, I don&rsquo;t mean a 3rd gender. Here I&rsquo;m saying that over time especially in queer and neurodivergent spaces my understanding of gender has changed. It has made me question the old definition. The best way I can describe the new definition of gender is that it is something that describes you. A while ago I admit in my head I was confused, didn&rsquo;t understand, and thought Xenogenders were kind of silly(Though later I&rsquo;d realize this thought was just holding me back) even if I didn&rsquo;t say it since I still wanted to treat people respectfully. More and more though I&rsquo;m understanding that these Xenogenders unlock a new way of self-expression saying &ldquo;Hey this is how I experience life, this is me&rdquo;. This new gender is a messy way of trying to describe your experiences and who you are.</p><h3 id=so-why-does-this-new-version-of-gender-matter>So why does this new version of gender matter?</h3><p>This new definition of gender allows us to understand each other better. Maybe it even for once describes how you actually want to be treated. It does the job of the old gender system but way better. It might not tell you what is in their pants but why does that matter? And I&rsquo;m sure there are many arguments to that one, but all I could come up with is that it all comes down to fear and probably their own sexuality. I suppose I can see the point that if you are flirting with them maybe you might want to know if you would be sexually compatible. This makes sense to me and right now I don&rsquo;t have the answer for how to solve this.</p><h4 id=potential-solutions-to-sexual-incompatibilities>Potential Solutions to sexual incompatibilities</h4><p>Maybe if society were different it would be an easier problem. For example, if being polyam were more normal then there&rsquo;s far less of an issue with having partners who you are sexually incompatible with but still love and still being able to have a way that won&rsquo;t end in sexual frustration. Of course, I&rsquo;m sure there are a lot of other ways to solve this issue most of which are hypothetical since it would be very hard to change society towards this especially with even just the core topic of this article being so political now but I&rsquo;m getting off-topic.</p><h2 id=a-more-true-me>A more true me</h2><p>I&rsquo;m AMAB and growing up learned some of the rules of being a boy. I also didn&rsquo;t fit into these rules, norms, and stereotypes. For ages, I masked it, hid it for fear I was sinning for just wanting to be a girl. Going by what I learned I would forever be a boy. That could never be changed, but getting to pick my gender is so much more freeing. I&rsquo;m not trapped. I get to express myself much more openly.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been going through this mess learning what I can to be more accepting and in turn found that I have a lot to learn and accept about myself. Gender is a part of self. Constantly gender has defined me telling me what I can and can&rsquo;t do from what I wear to the bathrooms I use to what society expects of me. This is something I had no say in. Something that doesn&rsquo;t fit me at all and the more I try to fit in it hurts. So what ends up happening? I buried it. I masked. I tried to blend in. I knew trans people existed. I knew people used they/them pronouns&mldr; and yet I never considered it for me. Not until COVID-19 that I found a little place on the internet where I started relating to the memes a bit too much. Being able to change my gender to something that fits so much better was amazing. To be treated how I wanted to be treated felt good. I was the girl in my profile picture. I was a more authentic me online than I ever could be offline. Offline I had to mask, but online I could show my true colors and I had friends. I could be treated like me and not like the social norms of a gender and system that doesn&rsquo;t serve me. I also like how instead of fitting into a predefined box my gender identity and pronouns can change to better suit me the more I learn about myself. I can grow with my gender identity.</p><h2 id=gender-expression-and-the-cost-of-not-being-able-to-express-it>Gender Expression and the cost of not being able to express it</h2><p>Gender expression is important like any other form of self-expression. Without it, a trans individual will likely feel dysphoria. This dysphoria in turn pulls down self-confidence and may lead to the person masking or hiding. I know I have done both of these things a ton. Masking isn&rsquo;t good because it builds relationships onto of a person who isn&rsquo;t you. This can cause you to feel like you can never show your true self and then you are trapped in this cycle of faking it and it&rsquo;s exhausting. Breaking this cycle is also very hard and scary and can lead to relationships breaking down. Of course, other things also lead to masking totally unrelated to gender expression but it can play a bigger role than you might think not being comfortable in your own skin, clothes, or whatever it is that you have to fake it to fit in. Ignoring, masking, and hiding it will all just hurt more in the long run.</p><h2 id=but-im-fine-with-my-gender>But I&rsquo;m fine with my gender</h2><p>For a while, I thought the same. I thought all boys want to be a girl but we just couldnt speak about it. I never questioned it for years and years. If you are reading this then perhaps you have some self-discovery to do. Maybe you are just reading it for fun, or maybe you are just curious but it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to do a little self-exploration to learn who you are better.</p><h2 id=politics>Politics</h2><p>Right now gender is a very heated topic. Many would say this article is very &ldquo;woke&rdquo;. My very existence is being threatened for this or I&rsquo;m being threatened by the fact that I might once again have to hide in a gender that doesn&rsquo;t fit me which was decided without me at my birth. It&rsquo;s very scary and why is this even a political issue? My guess is it&rsquo;s because its something many people don&rsquo;t understand and what people don&rsquo;t understand is scary. From there politicians used people&rsquo;s fears against them to twist us into monsters. This couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth because most of us are just a bunch of neurodivergent people who don&rsquo;t fit into the current system. I wish people would meet something new and unknown with interest and curiosity and not a threat to their way of life.</p><p>Allowing trans people to exist doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to date them, we only ask for respect and to be treated like any other person. We aren&rsquo;t here to harm or deceive, we just want to be comfy in our own skin.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>So while many people who don&rsquo;t understand will say it&rsquo;s silly and doesn&rsquo;t matter and can&rsquo;t be changed they will never know how much it means to me that I could change it to fit me and not have to try to fit it. Gender is about so much more than what&rsquo;s in my pants. Gender is a mess but looking closer and with a bit of acceptance it&rsquo;s not that hard.</p><h5 id=a-little-backstory-behind-this-blog-post>A little backstory behind this blog post</h5><p>Originally this wasnt supposed to be a blog post. I thought it was way too different from my usual posts but in the end about half a year later I was convinced that its actually really good and that I should release it. I hope that it is able to help someone.</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-lastmod><svg class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-clock" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><polyline points="12 7 12 12 15 15"/></svg>
